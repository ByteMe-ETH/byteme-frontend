## The problem it solves

Chess3 introduces a secure and transparent platform for betting on chess games using blockchain technology. Traditional online betting platforms suffer from issues like lack of transparency, potential for fraud, and delayed payouts. Chess3 solves these problems by leveraging smart contracts to ensure fair play and instant, trustless payouts. It also provides a decentralized environment where players can bet on their games or on matches of other players, with all transactions recorded immutably on the blockchain.
